<p><em>This blog post is the second part of a multi-part series. This series aims to walk readers through the potential uses of accessibility measures in transportation equity planning. This post explores different accessibility measures and how impedance function selection impacts results. Read the first post (<strong>LINK TO POST1</strong>) for an introduction to what is accessibility and defining impedance functions. In a subsequent posts, accessibility methods to conceptualize and analysis equity will be explored.</em></p>
<!-- In *"Unifying accessibility"*, a journal article by [@wuUnifyingAccess2020], a unifying feature between many of the accessibility measures used in the literature is clarified: all accessibility measures use some form of travel impedance and reachable opportunities evaluation. We deviate from [@wuUnifyingAccess2020] definitions.. -->
<p><em>Accessibility</em> (or <em>access</em>) has many definitions. Within the context of transportation planning, accessibility can be defined as a measure of the amount of interaction a population potentially has with opportunities in a given region. It is a product of the land-use and the population’s means of transportation: the population are the people that live within the region and the opportunities are the destinations of interest to the population or of the transportation network itself.</p>
<p>In this post, we distinguish between two types of accessibility measure conceptualizations: <em>unconstrained</em> and <em>constrained</em> measures. This distinction is important to help those interested in advocating for, planning and researching transportation, interpret outputs. This interpretation can allow us to quantify <em>how much</em> access to opportunities should be increased by and better formulate equity targets.</p>
<p>First, let’s detail <strong>unconstrained</strong> accessibility. The general form of the unconstrained measure is represented as <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> and is the measure proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="hansen1959">(<a href="#ref-hansen1959" role="doc-biblioref">Hansen 1959</a>)</span>. This measure is from which many accessibility measures are derived and continue to derive from to this day. <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> is an accessibility value that is calculated for each spatial unit. This value is the summation of all the <span class="math inline">\(O_j\)</span> available (i.e., reachable) at each spatial unit according to some impedance function <span class="math inline">\(f(c_{ij})\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> is defined in <a href="#eq-hansen-access">Equation&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-hansen-access"><span class="math display">\[
S_i = \sum_{j=1}^JO_j \cdot f(c_{ij})
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Where for both unconstrained (<span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>) and constrained measure (<span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> is a measure of the cost of moving between <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> is an impedance function of <span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span>; it can take the form of any monotonically decreasing function chosen based on positive or normative criteria <span class="citation" data-cites="paez2012measuring">(<a href="#ref-paez2012measuring" role="doc-biblioref">Paez, Scott, and Morency 2012</a>)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is a set of origin locations (<span class="math inline">\(i = 1,\cdots,N\)</span>).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is a set of destination locations (<span class="math inline">\(j = 1,\cdots,J\)</span>).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(O_j\)</span> is the number of opportunities at location <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(O = \sum_{j=1}^J O_j\)</span> is the total supply of opportunities in the study region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many variations of <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> have been proposed - but largely they focus on tweaks to the <span class="math inline">\(f(c_{ij})\)</span> operationalized. This measure fundamentally counts <span class="math inline">\(O_j\)</span> (after being weighted by <span class="math inline">\(f(c_{ij})\)</span>) for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. This means that the score that is assigned to each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the summation of all the opportunities that can be <em>potentially</em> interacted with. However, counting all opportunities of potential interaction may not make sense for certain opportunities.</p>
<p>As a hypothetical example, one can live in a part of the city where one has relatively exceptional accessibility to job opportunities as a result of land-use and transit options. Say this accessibility is a value of “100,000 potential job opportunities”. However, imagine if their neighbourhood and their adjacent neighbourhoods have 150,000 people who can also reach those same 100,000 job opportunities. Though they can potentially interact with a <em>relatively</em> high accessibility value of 100,000 opportunities, they may have less <em>available</em> opportunities as a result of <em>relatively</em> high neighbouring demand for opportunities. When compared to other areas of the city with <em>relatively</em> lower accessibility values but with a similar level of job opportunities and population demand, those other areas in the city may have more potential spatial <em>availability</em> than the neighbourhood where our hypothetical person lives.</p>
<p>This is the concept of <em>competition</em>, and has been applied to the <em>unconstrained</em> accessibility measure within the influential works of <span class="citation" data-cites="shen1998">Shen (<a href="#ref-shen1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="weibull_axiomatic_1976">Weibull (<a href="#ref-weibull_axiomatic_1976" role="doc-biblioref">1976</a>)</span>, as well as the widely used in the two-step floating catchment approach (2SFCA) approach of <span class="citation" data-cites="luo2003">Luo and Wang (<a href="#ref-luo2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. These works can be thought to adjust <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> (unconstrained accessibility) to account for the population’s demand for opportunities in the region of interest.</p>
<p>In the recently published journal article by <span class="citation" data-cites="soukhovIntroducingSpatialAvailability2023">(<a href="#ref-soukhovIntroducingSpatialAvailability2023" role="doc-biblioref">Soukhov et al. 2023</a>)</span>, we propose an alternative derivation of <span class="citation" data-cites="shen1998">Shen (<a href="#ref-shen1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> accessibility with competition that explicitly clarifies an inconsistency in its formulation. We conceptualize this measure as competitive accessibility that is <em>singly constrained</em> (akin to singly-constrained spatial interaction models (<strong>LINK?</strong>)).</p>
<p>In other words, the total number of opportunities in the study region are preserved i.e.&nbsp;if a city has 1,000,000 opportunities a proportion of those opportunities are allocated to each spatial units in the region such that all the spatial availability scores sum up to equal 1,000,000. Spatial availability <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> and its mathematical formulation is defined in <a href="#eq-spatial-avail">Equation&nbsp;2</a>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-spatial-avail"><span class="math display">\[
V_i = \sum_{j=1}^NO_jF^t_{ij} \\
\text{Where: } F^t_{ij} = \frac{F^p_{i} \cdot F^c_{ij}}{\sum_{i=1}^N F^p_{i} \cdot F^c_{ij}}
\tag{2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> contains all the parameters from <em>unconstrained</em> accessibility measure in addition to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F^t_{ij}\)</span> is a balancing factor defined the population balancing factor (<span class="math inline">\(F^p_{i} = \frac{P_{i}^\alpha}{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i}^\alpha}\)</span>) and travel impedance balancing factor (<span class="math inline">\(F^c_{ij} = \frac{f(c_{ij})}{\sum_{i=1}^N f(c_{ij})}\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be understood that both measures are a weighted sum of opportunities. <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> is the sum of all opportunities that can be potentially interacted with (i.e., <em>unconstrained</em> summation) while <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> allocates opportunities through the balancing factors in a <em>constrained</em> way.</p>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span>, the balancing factor <span class="math inline">\(F^p_{i}\)</span> corresponds to the proportion of the population in origin <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> relative to the population in the region. On the right hand side of the equation, the numerator <span class="math inline">\(P_{i}^\alpha\)</span> is the population at origin <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The summation in the denominator is over <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\cdots,N\)</span>, and adds up to the total population of the region. Notice that we incorporate an empirical parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. The role of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is to modulate the effect of demand by population. When <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &lt;1\)</span>, opportunities are allocated more rapidly to smaller centers relative to larger ones; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha&gt;1\)</span> achieves the opposite effect.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F^c_{ij}\)</span>, the impedance balancing factor, uses the impedance function to proportionally allocate more jobs to closer population centers, that is, to those with populations <em>more willing to reach the jobs</em>. Indeed, <span class="math inline">\(F^c_{ij}\)</span> can be thought of as the proportion of the population at <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> willing to travel to destination <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, conditional on the travel behavior as described by the impedance function.</p>
<p>Overall, these two measures can be complex to understand - but the outputs may demonstrate their intuition more clearly! In what follows, we calculate and visualize the <em>unconstrained</em> and <em>constrained</em> accessibility measures defined. We use the best-fitting probability distribution functions as impedance functions (defined in the previous post (<strong>LINK TO POST1</strong>)) as inputs in both measures <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span>.</p>

<h1>Differences in accessibility results</h1>
<p>For the purpose of this demonstration, unconstrained and constrained accessibility is calculated using data taken from the R data package {TTS0216R} and the home-to-work flows are provided at the spatial unit of traffic analysis zones (TAZ). {TTS0216R} contains a subset of home-to-work flows from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) as well as calculated road-network car travel times (calculated using {r5r}). {TTS2016R} is detailed in this publication <span class="citation" data-cites="soukhovTTS2016RDataSet2023">(<a href="#ref-soukhovTTS2016RDataSet2023" role="doc-biblioref">Soukhov and Páez 2023</a>)</span> and is freely available to be explored <a href="https://soukhova.github.io/TTS2016R/">here</a>. The focus of this demonstration is on an urban planning boundary in Hamilton, Ontario.</p>
<p>The plots of the impedance functions used for both accessibility calculations are plotted in <a href="#fig-TLD-all">Figure&nbsp;1</a>: uniform function (red, <span class="math inline">\(T_{min}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{max}\)</span> is 0 and 45 mins), exponential function (green, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> (rate) is 0.05), and gamma function (blue, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (shape) is 2 and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> (rate) is 0.09. The data set and parameters were fit and discussed in the first blog post (<strong>LINK TO POST1</strong>).</p>

<p>In the following, we use the {accessibility} package to conveniently calculate unconstrained accessibility <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> (<a href="#eq-hansen-access">Equation&nbsp;1</a>) using the gravity() function, singly-constrained accessibility <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> (<a href="#eq-spatial-avail">Equation&nbsp;2</a>) using the spatial_availability() function and the defined impedance functions shown in the above <a href="#fig-TLD-all">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. We plot the resulting scores for the Hamilton Center area for each impedance function as follows:</p>

</div>

</div>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>In <a href="#fig-con-and-unconstrained-access">Figure&nbsp;2</a> above, we visualize all accessibility values as a percentage of the sum of the total values in the region for each calculation (i.e., the total values: 3.2277^{4}, 4.5005^{4}, and 4.8093^{4} jobs for <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> using binary, exponential, and gamma functions respectively and 1.0404^{5} jobs for <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> for all functions).</p>
<p>The value for each calculation is normalized because each impedance function weights the opportunities counted in differing ways and there is no process that evenly limits or redistributes the summation. As such, a common accessibility maximum across all plots cannot be determined since accessibility is a function of the summation of weighted opportunities. For this reason, the normalization of the accessibility values is done to make sense of relative ‘highs’ and ‘lows’ in the region.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the top row in <a href="#fig-con-and-unconstrained-access">Figure&nbsp;2</a>: unconstrained accessibility. Before normalization, the raw values can be understood as the number of job opportunities that people within Hamilton Center can potentially interact based on an empirically-fitted impedance function. For instance, for neighbourhoods with “high” accessibility (Greens - 1.80% relative values or higher), according to the uniform impedance this means they can interact with 576 jobs or more given a 45 min car travel time (our selected max threshold). For the exponential and gamma functions this “high” relative value is equivalent to 810 and 864 or higher potential jobs interactions. These raw values are difficult to interpret, so seeing a neighbourhood as being an area of relative ‘high’, ‘medium’ or ‘low’ accessibility value simplifies the interpretation of ‘potential interaction’.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, the trends across the top row visually look similar: TAZ that have ‘high’, ‘medium’ and ‘low’ values are similar across all plots. This indicates that the selection of impedance function, at least within this visualization, does not result in too much variation in the results. As discussed in the first post (<strong>LINK TO BLOG POST1</strong>), the selection of parameters for all impedance functions were optimally derived from empirical home-to-work travel flows, so seeing similar trends across plots is not unexpected. The selection of the parameters may matter more than the shape (i.e., type of theoretical distribution selected).</p>
<p>Next, let’s look at the second row in <a href="#fig-con-and-unconstrained-access">Figure&nbsp;2</a>: the visualization of singly-constrained accessibility (spatial availability <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span>). Across all plots, the trends are even more similar than the trends across the top row of plots. This is because, the total sum of opportunities is the same across all impedance functions as the result of the proportional allocation feature.</p>
<p>Also, of note are the differences between <em>constrained</em> and <em>unconstrained</em> plots: namely, TAZ with low values (red) are often low in both plots, however, many low/medium value TAZ have high value TAZ in the second row. Why? Because opportunity-seeking competition is considered in the constrained calculations!</p>
<p>For instance, in the top row, some TAZ in the south have medium (yellowish) singly-constrained values. This is the result of relatively average impedance values. However, looking at the bottom row, the same relatively average impedance values combined with relatively <em>low</em> competition results in TAZ result in relatively high (green) values under the constrained calculation. This indicates that though some TAZ have medium/low <em>unconstrained</em> accessibility (i.e., potential interaction), when considering the neighbours who are competing for the same opportunities, the <em>constrained</em> accessibility score is high. These TAZ may in fact have fine accessibility levels, considering their low competition, and the focus should be improving areas with low constrained accessibility (red).</p>
<p>Across both rows, we can see common low values (red) TAZ located in the north end of the city. From unconstrained accessibility, we know these TAZ have high relative travel impedance - this is most likely because people who work in the north end do not live in Hamilton Center and thus have high travel times (recall: the accessibility calculations in this demonstration only considers trips that originate from Hamilton Center, almost 50% of those who live within Hamilton Center travel to areas outside of Hamilton Center for work). Interestingly though, we can see that there is a high relative number of jobs within these TAZ (see <a href="#fig-worker-job-plot">Figure&nbsp;3</a> below), however, even the number of jobs does not balance out the impedance value and higher demand for those jobs. Hence, the unconstrained accessibility measure is also low.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-points">Concluding points</h2>
<p>Accessibility measures characterize the relationship between land-use and transportation travel impedance. How the relationship is conceptualization (if there’s competition or not) and how the travel impedance should be weighted (what function describes travel behaviour) are critical.</p>
<p>Depending on how this analysis is conducted will shed light on regions of inequitable accessibility. From our plots, areas that have low unconstrained accessibility (<span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>) are worth inspecting but areas with low constrained (<span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span>) should be prioritized. Since places of employment are non-divisible (only 1 person can take 1 job), taking into consideration competition matters for this opportunity type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the accessibility values represent the number of jobs that could <em>potentially</em> be reached by from each origin. We should take action in increasing accessibility in areas that are yellow and red to reduce inequities of access. But by using constrained accessibility measures - we can see that not all yellow and red areas have low constrained accessibility. They may have relatively fine accessibility given their neighbouring demand for opportunities.</p>
<p>Access to opportunities is a multi-faceted concept. The use of multiple indicators can illuminate spatial patterns of inequities and add another layer of confidence to the quantitative analysis. But our journey is not done. Once these spatial inequities have been identified - what do we do about it?</p>
<p>Another advantage of using competitive accessibility, namely spatial availability, is the proportional allocation feature. Since the number of opportunities for the region is proportionally allocated to each origin - the raw output can be used to plan for how many more opportunities are needed for each origin. Further, because spatial availability values per origin can also be divided by population at that origin. This can be interpreted as an opportunity per capita value. This value can be used as a benchmark to compare again opportunity per capita across areas of the region and between regions. This, along with different equity conceptualizations, will be explored in a following post.</p>
